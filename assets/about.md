## About University Timetable System

The University Timetable System was conceived by Dr. Josuah Dagadu (Ph.D.) and developed as a Final Year Undergraduate Design Science Research Project by Mr. Frimpong Nyamaah Emmanuel. The initial development team in 2022 included Mr. Peter Hennry Bernasco, Mr. Blessie David, and Mr. Divine Yeaboah Obeng-Mframa.

The project began with Java FX and MySQL, but after acceptance and grading by Dr. Josuah Dagadu, it was further developed using Flutter and MongoDB by Mr. Frimpong Nyamaah Emmanuel who was assisted by Mr. Elvis Sarfo Antwi and Miss Sandra Asia Masuru. The system, now at version 1.0.1, was later acquired by the Akenten Appiah-Menka University of Skills Training and Entrepreneurial Development (AAMUSTED).

The University Timetable System aims to streamline the process of timetable generation for academic institutions, providing efficient scheduling solutions for administrators, faculty, and students alike.
